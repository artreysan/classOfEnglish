        And now for the latest new in the art world. If you're in Paris this weekend, you might like to visit the new David Hockney exhibition called Fresh Flowers. As the name suggests, most of the picture depict flowers. However, these are no ordinary flower pictures, because Hockney use his iPhone or his iPad to draw them. <br>
        Hockney started painting on his iPhone during the winter of 2007. At the time, he was staying at his home in northern England where he has a beautiful view out of his bedroom windows. One morning, he picked up his iPhone and used his fingers to paint the sunrise. He was very happy with the result, and started experimenting with other pictures. Now, he sends his friends a different flower picture every morning. They love it! <br>
        Fresh Flowers is at the Foundation Pierre Berge, Yves Saint Laurent in Paris until January 29th. The exhibition show the drawings Hockney made on an iPhone and the pictures he drew on an iPad. The gallery is open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Tuesday to Friday, and admission costs five euros. Don't miss this show: it will be a bright moment in your day. <br>
