          Till death do us part
          But we're already past that phase
          This is a brand new start
          And I think I deserve some praise
          
          For the way that I am
          Despite having overdosed
          And ending up comatose
          
          I don't give a damn
          I've let my emotions go
          Fuck being a sober hoe
          
          This is the mantra
          This is my life you're playing with now till the end of the night
          Surrounded by fire the passion ignites
          A hit of that heaven and hell, a helluva high
          
          I'm addicted to the madness
          This hotel is my Atlantis
          We're forever gonna have a fucking reason to sin
          Let me leave my soul to burn and I'll be breathing it in
          
          I'm addicted to the feeling
          Getting higher than the ceiling
          And we're never gonna want this fucking feeling to end
          Just concede and give in to your inner demons again
          
          Yeah, you fell in love
          But you fell deeper in this pit
          While death rains from above
          So count your blessings 'cause this is it

          You're not letting it go
          So what if I misbehave
          It's what everybody craves

          You already know
          So come if you're feeling brave
          And fancy yourself a mate

          You want it, I got it, see what you like?
          We could have it all by the end of the night
          Your money and power, my sinful delight
          A hit of that heaven and hell, a helluva high

          I'm addicted to the madness
          This hotel is my Atlantis
          We're forever gonna have a fucking reason to sin
          Let me leave my soul to burn and I'll be breathing it in

          I'm addicted to the feeling
          Getting higher than the ceiling
          And we're never gonna want this fucking feeling to end
          Just concede and give in to your inner demons again

          Just concede and give in to your inner demons again

          I'm addicted to the feeling
          Getting higher than the ceiling
          And we're never gonna want this fucking feeling to end
          Just concede and give in to your inner demons again

          I'm addicted to the sorrow
          When the buzz ends by tomorrow
          There's another rush of poison flowing into my veins
          Giving me a dose of pleasure that resides by the pain

          I'm addicted, I'm dependent
          Looking awesome, feeling helpless
          And I know I'm raising Cain by every highway of hell
          Maybe things won't be so terrible inside this hotel
